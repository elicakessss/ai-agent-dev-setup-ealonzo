**Workshop Cohort:** September Cohort

This first week of the AI Agent Developer program marked a major shift in how I understand software development and my role within it. Transitioning from traditional programming to an AI-centric development mindset has been both exciting and eye-opening. I’ve always thought of software development as writing logic, structuring code, and solving problems manually. But this week challenged that perspective completely. I now see that modern development is no longer just about coding—it’s about orchestrating AI systems, integrating tools, and designing workflows where agents and humans collaborate to build solutions faster and more intelligently.

One of the most impactful realizations for me was understanding how AI agents are becoming core components of enterprise systems. Instead of thinking of AI as an “assistant,” I’m starting to see it as an active collaborator. The MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture especially opened my eyes to how AI tools can extend their abilities by connecting to external services. Before this workshop, I never imagined that I could plug a large language model into different servers—like Rolldice, Bootcamp AI Agent, Calendar Booking, or even GitHub—and instantly give it new capabilities. Seeing these servers working inside Claude Desktop made the concept feel real and practical.

Setting up the development environment was another major milestone. Installing Node.js, configuring VS Code Insider, enabling GitHub Copilot, and integrating Claude Desktop formed a full professional workflow. It was the first time I felt like I was building a development stack specifically designed for AI-first software engineering. Working with Git and GitHub reinforced good version control habits, and the process of creating a public repository for my setup helped me understand how an AI agent developer must maintain clear documentation and iterative commits. Even the small challenges—like configuration errors or MCP connection issues—taught me how important troubleshooting skills are in this new field.

Connecting multiple MCP servers through Claude Desktop was the highlight of the week. I began to understand how MCP bridges the gap between an AI model’s reasoning and real-world tools or data. Instead of being limited to what the AI “knows,” I learned how to extend its abilities using structured tool connections. This changed how I interact with AI tools in general. They feel more powerful, more modular, and capable of performing real tasks beyond static responses.

Comparing Claude Desktop’s free developer mode with ChatGPT’s Developer Mode also gave me insight into how different platforms implement MCP. It made me appreciate Claude’s open and accessible setup while also becoming curious about ChatGPT’s more advanced, subscription-based capabilities.

As I look ahead to the remaining nine weeks, I expect the program to push me further into hands-on AI development. I hope to build my own MCP server, deepen my understanding of AI-driven architectures, and learn how to combine agents, tools, workflows, and real applications. Most importantly, I want to gain the confidence to build solutions where AI is not just assisting me but actively collaborating with me. This first week laid the foundation, and I’m excited to keep growing into the role of an AI Agent Developer.
